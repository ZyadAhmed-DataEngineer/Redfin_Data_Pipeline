###ðŸš€Redfin Data Pipeline with Amazon EMR ðŸš€
    This project delivers a comprehensive ETL pipeline designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) real estate data from the Redfin website into an Amazon S3 bucket, The pipeline is built using a powerful combination of AWS tools and open-source frameworks to ensure seamless and scalable data processing.

###ðŸ”§Key Technologies Used

1- Amazon S3 for scalable object storage.
2- AWS EMR to leverage the power of distributed computing.
3- PySpark & Apache Spark for efficient big data processing.
4- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development and experimentation.

###ðŸŒŸProject Overview

##This pipeline provides an end-to-end solution for processing Redfin real estate data:

1) Extract raw data directly from the Redfin website.
2) Store the extracted data securely in an Amazon S3 bucket.
3) Transform the data using PySpark on AWS EMR for fast, distributed processing.
4) Load the transformed data back into Amazon S3, making it readily available for further analysis or integration.

###âœ¨Why This Project?

The goal of this pipeline is to enable efficient and scalable processing of large real estate datasets, unlocking valuable insights from Redfin data. Whether you're working with data-driven applications, conducting real estate market analysis, or building machine learning models, this pipeline provides the foundation for high-quality data handling.
